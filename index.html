                <p class="intro-text">Immunohistochemistry &#40;IHC&#41; is a powerful technique, indispensable in research and in clinical diagnostics. It is a staple of the pathology lab for disease diagnostics and classification. In research, IHC is used to interrogate many biological processes, including visualization of protein expression patterns, characterizing protein interactions, and identification of tissue boundaries. The researcher can thereby observe the distribution and localization of specific structures within the context of the cellular architecture.</p>

                        <p class="read-more-text">Analytes of interest may be detected on the surface of the tissue or interrogated internally through permeabilization of the sample. The analyte &#40;antigen&#41; can be detected directly &#40;A&#41;, or indirectly &#40;B&#41; using a fluorescent &#40;immunofluorescence&#41; or reporter enzyme &#40;colorimetric&#41; probe conjugated to a secondary antibody. The peroxidase anti-peroxidase &#40;PAP&#41; method can also be used &#40;C&#41;.</p>

                <p>Monovalent Fab fragments of affinity-purified secondary antibodies are offered to block endogenous immunoglobulins in tissue sections or on cell surfaces, to cover &#40;block&#41; immunoglobulins when double labeling primary antibodies from the same host species, or to Fab-label primary antibodies prior to incubation with the experimental sample. They can be used for these purposes because each Fab fragment has only a single antigen binding site &#40;i.e. they are monovalent&#41;, and they are non-precipitating.</p>
